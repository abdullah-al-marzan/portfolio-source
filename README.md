### About This Project

This website was built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to serve as a comprehensive, dynamic, and professional online presence. It showcases my academic background, research projects (ongoing and previous), publications, and skills in a clean, user-friendly, and fully responsive format. The goal was to create a central, high-performance hub for my professional and academic work.

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid), JavaScript (ES6)
* **Hosting & Deployment:** Deployed on **Netlify** with a custom domain, with source code version-controlled on **GitHub**.
* **Performance:** Optimized images, clean URLs (`/about/`), and a sitemap submitted to Google Search Console for professional SEO.
* **User Experience (UX):**
    * Fully responsive design for all devices, from mobile to desktop.
    * Premium "fade and slide up" animations on page scroll.
    * An elegant, multi-stage welcome animation for first-time visitors.
